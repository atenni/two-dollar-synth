# Two dollar synth (demo app for presentation)

A super simple web based synth using the browser native [Web Audio API].

[Web Audio API]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API

- No third party libraries (use the platform!)
- Built with native [Web Components] (`HTMLElement` custom elements + Shadow
  DOM)
- Published to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

[Web Components]:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components

## Project overview

A polyphonic synthesizer playable in the browser via a piano-style keyboard.
Notes are generated entirely with the Web Audio API — no audio samples, no
libraries. The UI is decomposed into native Web Components (custom elements with
Shadow DOM), styled with plain CSS to be clean and tactile.

## Project goals

- Polyphonic keyboard (mouse, touch, and computer-keyboard input)
- Multiple waveform types (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
- ADSR envelope control (attack, decay, sustain, release)
- Master volume and per-voice gain
- Responsive layout, works on desktop and mobile

### Module responsibilities

| File                | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `engine.js`         | Creates and manages the `AudioContext`. Exposes `noteOn(freq)` / `noteOff(freq)` which spin up and tear down oscillator → gain (ADSR) → master gain → destination chains.                        |
| `synth-keyboard.js` | Custom element `<synth-keyboard>`. Renders a two-octave piano keyboard inside Shadow DOM. Dispatches a custom `note-on` / `note-off` event that `main.js` bridges to the audio engine.           |
| `synth-controls.js` | Custom element `<synth-controls>`. Encapsulates waveform radio buttons, ADSR range inputs, and volume knob inside Shadow DOM. Dispatches `controls-change` events with updated parameter values. |
| `main.js`           | Registers custom elements (`customElements.define`), initialises the audio engine, and wires component events to engine calls. Handles the `AudioContext` resume-on-first-gesture requirement.   |
| `deploy.yml`        | On every push to `main`, copies the repo contents to GitHub Pages using `actions/deploy-pages`. No build step required — the project is plain HTML/CSS/JS.                                       |

## Testing

Tests run with [Vitest] (dev dependency only — the shipped app remains
dependency-free).

[Vitest]: https://vitest.dev

```bash
npm install        # installs vitest
npm test           # run all tests once
npm run test:watch # watch mode
```

The `jsdom` environment is used so DOM APIs are available without a real
browser. The Web Audio API is not implemented in jsdom, so `AudioContext` and
related nodes are mocked inside each test file.

| Test file                | What it covers                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `engine.test.js`         | `noteOn` / `noteOff` create and disconnect the correct node graph; ADSR parameters are applied; duplicate `noteOn` calls for the same frequency are handled safely.         |
| `synth-keyboard.test.js` | Custom element registers and renders; MIDI-frequency formula (`440 * 2^((n-69)/12)`); pointer/keyboard events dispatch correct `note-on` / `note-off` custom events.        |
| `synth-controls.test.js` | Custom element registers and renders; waveform selection, ADSR slider changes, and volume input all dispatch `controls-change` with correct payload; values clamp to range. |

## Local development

Run the app through a local web server so ES modules load correctly.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

Do not open `index.html` directly via `file://` — custom elements and module
imports may fail to initialize in that mode.
